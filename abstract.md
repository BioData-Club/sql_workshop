SQL is the most popular programming language for generating and interacting with relational databases and is therefore an extremely marketable language to learn or at least be aware of. This workshop will give attendees a gentle introduction to relational databases and how to use SQL to make queries. We will use the Python programming language to create a database and query data in SQLite. We will also use Jupyter notebooks to teach the course, so at the end of the workshop, attendees will have a basic script that they can take with them and modify to create and query their own databases. No previous coding, SQL, or database experience is required.
